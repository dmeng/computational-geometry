    <h1>What is the Axis-Aligned Art Gallery problem?</h1>

    <p>First, let's define the Art Gallery problem. </p>

    <p>Given a polygon P, we want to find a set S such that for every point p in the polygon, there exists a q in S such that the line segment between p and q lies entirely in the polygon. The interesting part is the question of how large must such a set S be. Chvatal proved in 1973 that n/3 points is always sufficient for a polygon with n points. </p>

    <p>For the "Axis-Aligned" version of the problem, we will restrict the set of polygons we are looking at to the set of polygons whose edges are parallel to the x- and y- axes.</p>
