    <h1>What is the Rectilinear Art Gallery problem?</h1>

    <p>First, let's define the Art Gallery problem. </p>

    <p>Given a polygon P, we want to find a set S such that for every point p in the polygon, there exists a q in S such that the line segment between p and q lies entirely in the polygon.
       The interesting part is the question of how large must such a set S be. Chvatal proved in 1973 that n/3 points is always sufficient for a polygon with n points. </p>

    <p>For the "rectilinear" version of the problem, we will restrict the set of polygons we are looking at to the set of polygons whose edges are all horizontal or vertical.
       This itself spawns other variants that we may discuss here. </p>

    <!--
        Variants include the Polyomino Art Gallery problem, where each polygon is now a polyomino (possibly with holes). Well known examples of polyominoes 
        include dominoes, tetrominoes (the Tetris pieces), and pentominoes.
